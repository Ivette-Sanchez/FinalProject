            <div class="content-square">
                <p> Hello! I'm Ivette Sanchez-Perez, a Computer Science student at Fordham University with a strong passion for both technology 
                    and the humanities. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Anthropology. My journey 
                    into the tech world began with a love for logic and problem-solving, and over time, I’ve deepened my knowledge through coursework, 
                    projects, and hands-on experience. While my major is rooted in technology, my minor in Anthropology reflects my fascination with the 
                    world’s diverse cultures and the people that shape them. I enjoy exploring how technology intersects with human behavior and society, 
                    giving me a broader and more holistic perspective on the world. 
                </p>
                <p> Born and raised in the Bronx, I’ve been fortunate to grow up in a vibrant cultural environment, influenced by my Puerto Rican mother 
                    and Dominican father. Fluent in both Spanish and English, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the diversity of cultures and 
                    perspectives around me. This background fuels my passion for learning and adapting across different fields, enabling me to combine my 
                    technical expertise with my cultural heritage to approach problems in innovative ways. 
                </p>

            <div class="introduction"> Internships </div>
            <div class="content-square">
                <p>I'm excited to begin my summer internship with Lavner Education at NYU, where I’ll be teaching and mentoring students in technology subjects 
                    possibly being coding, robotics, or even web programming. This role allows me to blend my technical knowledge with my passion for education, 
                    helping inspire younger learners to explore the creative and logical aspects of technology.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="introduction"> Volunteer Work & Clubs </div>
            <div class="content-square">
                <p> I’m dedicated to giving back to my community through education. In Highschool I’ve worked as a Spanish Teaching Assistant for a year where I supported 
                    students in developing both their Spanish reading and writing skills by regularly checking in and clarifying course materials to make sure everyone was on track.
                    I would also conduct individual and group meetings to help students enhance their Spanish speaking and writing skills and tailoring my assistance to their specific needs. 
                </p>    
                <p> Additionally, I’ve worked as a Reading tutor for children ages 5-7 in a non-profit organisation called Read Alliance. In this program 
                    I had one-on-one sessions with students where I guided students through books to elevate their reading levels to meet educational standards. My duty was to 
                    assess and track student progress to ensure students were prepared to advance to more challenging materials. 
                </p>
                <p> In addition, I served as Vice President of the Film Club, where I helped organize events, screenings, and discussions around storytelling in cinema. It was a great way to 
                    connect with others who share a love for film, while also building leadership and collaboration skills.
                </p>

            <div class="introduction"> Hobbies & Interests </div>
            <div class="content-square">
                <p> Outside of academics and tech, I’m passionate about creative expression. I love painting, drawing, and working with clay—anything that allows me to bring ideas and imagination to life. 
                    These hobbies not only allow me to unwind but also inspire how I approach design in the tech world, influencing my work in user experience and interactive design.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="introduction"> Skills </div>
            <div class="content-square">
                <p>I’ve worked with a range of programming languages and tools including C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. 
                    I also have experience in full-stack development using PHP, MVC architecture, and have worked with RESTful APIs and 
                    database integration into web programs. On top of that, I enjoy creating visual and interactive content, using my skills in design and user experience to 
                    build projects that are both functional and engaging. </p>
